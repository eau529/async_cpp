abstract = {Visual programming tools are widely applied in the game industry to assist game designers in developing game artificial intelligence (game AI) and gameplay. However, testing multiple game engines is a time-consuming operation, which degrades development efficiency. To provide an asynchronous platform for game designers, this paper introduces Asyncflow, an open-source visual programming solution. It consists of a flowchart maker for game logic explanation and a runtime framework integrating an asynchronous mechanism based on an event-driven architecture. Asyncflow supports multiple programming languages and can be easily embedded in various game engines to run flowcharts created by game designers.}
